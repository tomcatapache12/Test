Thank You & Goodbye

Hi Team,

As today marks my last day at Goldman Sachs, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you. Working in the Mosaic team has been an incredible experience — one filled with great learning, collaboration, and a sense of shared purpose that made every project meaningful.

I feel truly fortunate to have worked alongside such talented, dedicated, and supportive people. The exposure I gained here — from building resilient systems to tackling challenging design problems — has shaped me both professionally and personally.

A special thanks to everyone I’ve closely worked with on the Mosaic platform and related initiatives — your guidance, teamwork, and encouragement have made my journey memorable.

While I’m moving on to explore a new opportunity, I’ll always carry forward the values, friendships, and experiences I’ve gained here. Please feel free to stay in touch — you can reach me at [your personal email ID] or on LinkedIn ([your LinkedIn link]).

Wishing all of you continued success and growth ahead!

Warm regards,
Angad Yadav
Mosaic Team
